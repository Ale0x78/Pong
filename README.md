# Very Good Pong
Simple two-player pong game coded in Lua using the Love2D framework. This game is a relic of my old Github Account, which I have lost control over due to an unfortunate 2FA incident. (RIP [@NAAleks](http://www.github.com/NAAleks))
None the less, the code was awful. The collision detections were glitchy; those glitches would cause the pong to bounce between the wall and the paddle, causing... *infinite points*.

The code is a mess. These patches still don't fix everything, but now the game does justice to my old GitHub account. So to some extent, let this code be my ode to the old account, full of High School experiments that taught me so much.
